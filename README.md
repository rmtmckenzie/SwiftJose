# SwiftJose
A library aiming to eventually be compatible with JOSE and support JWT/JWS/JWE written in Swift.

WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS NOT COMPLETE, TESTED, EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME API, OR TO STAY PUBLIC. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Also, I'm in no way an expert in Swift or iOS so I've probably commited at least 10 attrocities that no good iOS Developer could ever tolerate in code they would even consider including in their project.

Anyways, with that over with.... I'm putting this up publicly because I couldn't find any swift libraries that do anything beyond basic JWTs. In time if I have time I'm going to try to expand the library to perform more JWT/JWE/JWS operations according to the spec.


To use, include with Carthage - github "rmtmckenzie/SwiftJose"

This also has a dependency on SwCrypt - github "soyersoyer/SwCrypt"
